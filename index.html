					<h4>Testing is awesome again</code></h4>

					<p>
						GoConvey makes test-driven development in Go a
						genuine pleasure. Enjoy the luxuries of auto-test,
						colored terminal output, reporting in your browser,
						behavior-driven tests, a huge suite of assertions,
						a clean DSL, and more.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="grid-33">
					<h4>Use by running <code>go test</code></h4>

					<p>
						Since GoConvey is directly integrated with Go's <code>testing</code>
						package, you can keep using your existing native Go tests or
						use GoConvey's natural, easy-to-use composition style.
						Many people use GoConvey just for the web UI.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="grid-33">
					<h4>Get started</h4>

					<p>
						Assuming your GOPATH is set, <code>cd</code> to your project's folder and run:
					</p>

					<p>
						<code class="block"><span style="color: #888">$</span> <span style="color: #7C5110">go get</span> <a href="https://github.com/smartystreets/goconvey" target="_blank">github.com/smartystreets/goconvey</a>
<span style="color: #888">$</span> <span style="color: #1E557A;">$GOPATH</span>/bin/goconvey</code>
					</p>

					<p>
						Then open your browser to <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">localhost:8080</a>.

					<h3>Brilliant Web UI</h3>
					<img src="/goconvey/resources/images/ok.png">
				</div>

				<div class="grid-50">
					<h4>Test results update automatically</h4>
					<p>
						The GoConvey server watches all folders under a given
						"watched" directory, and when a file changes in those
						folders, tests are automatically run and the page is
						updated.
					</p>
					<p>
						You can manually invoke a re-run of the tests by clicking
						the <i class="fa fa-refresh"></i> icon in the top-right corner.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="grid-50">
					<h4>At-a-glance overview, or details if you want</h4>
					<p>
						View the immediate summary just by glancing at the
						bar across the top of the page. Green is passing, yellow
						is failed test, red is panic, and gray is build failed.
					</p>
					<p>
						Dig in to the <i>story view</i> of the page for details on
						tests, whether they passed or failed. You can collapse or
						ignore entire packages if they get in your way.
					</p>

					<h3>Gracefully examine failing tests</h3>
					<img src="/goconvey/resources/images/fail.png">
				</div>

				<div class="grid-50">
					<h4>Failures bubble to the top</h4>
					<p>
						Failing tests conveniently appear at the top of the page so
						you can quickly find and fix any problems. Many built-in
						assertions, such as <code>ShouldEqual</code>, provide a
						handy-dandy diff tool so you can see what's going on.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="grid-50">
					<h4>Shortcut links to get around</h4>
					<p>
						Click links to scroll to the test in context, or to open
						the file in Sublime Text at the exact line of the failing
						assertion. You can expand and collapse folders on the left
						side for links to shortcut to encapsulating <code>Test...</code>
						function names.

				<div class="grid-50">
					<h4>This is what a panic feels like</h4>
					<p>
						Imagine the little Golang gopher running around in
						its wheel and suddenly, it starts to panic. Fortunately,
						GoConvey makes it easy to recover your little gopher.

				<div class="grid-50 pull-50">
					<h4>Build failure output</h4>
					<p>
						Sometimes more frustrating than failed tests and even
						panics are build failures, because they're usually
						unexpected. GoConvey brings the output of <code>go test</code>
						to your browser so you can quickly pinpoint the compilation
						problems.

					<h3>HTML5 desktop notifications</h3>
					<img src="/goconvey/resources/images/notif.png" class="shadow">
				</div>

				<div class="grid-50">
					<h4>Heck, why waste screen space?</h4>
					<p>
						Even though GoConvey's web UI is responsive, sometimes
						you still want your editor to fill the screen.
						Or maybe you can't be bothered to take your eye off your code,
						even for a <i>second</i>. (GoConvey is written by fellow
						gophers. We understand!)
					</p>

					<p>
						Enable desktop notifications by clicking the <i class="fa fa-bell-o"></i>
						icon in the web UI and you can get test results in whatever
						window you have open.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="grid-50">
					<h4>Notifications that aren't annoying</h4>
					<p>
						Notifications disappear after about 3 seconds: just enough
						time for you to get the gist of the test results. If you
						need more details, your browser tab is waiting for you.
					</p>

					<p>
						Your notification preference is remembered using HTML5's
						<code>localStorage</code> feature, so you don't have to
						keep toggling them on and off.

				<div class="prefix-25 grid-50 suffix-25">
					<h4>Plenty of room for everything</h4>

					<p>
						GoConvey can squish alongside your editor if you have
						limited screen space and still want to see your test output.
						Plus, when test results update, your scroll position
						will be maintained when the screen is redrawn.
					</p>

				</div>

				<div class="grid-50">
					<h4>Write tests with natural language</h4>
					<p>
						Write GoConvey tests by typing your program's expected
						behavior, BDD-style. Don't worry about Go syntax in here,
						because that will be automatically stubbed out for you.
					</p>
				</div>

				<div class="grid-50">
					<h4>Smart input preserves tabs</h4>
					<p>
						Tab indentation is used to nest <code>Convey()</code> statements,
						and the textarea supports tab preservation on newlines, so you
						can focus purely on your program's behavior and tests.

					What's it feel to scroll down a whole mountain? Well, now you

					to writing code <i>not</i> under test.
